100+ Python challenging programming exercises for Python 3 with Solutions
## Question 1:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence. Example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180 The output of the program should be: 18,22,24
#### Solution
```python
>>>import math

### Question 13:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma. Example If the following passwords are given as input to the program: ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345 Then, the output of the program should be: ABd1234@1
```python
# Almost Done
import re
user_input = input("Enter a sequence of comma separated passwords : ").split(",")
pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,12}" # here is the problem ====>> [$#@]
# m = r"^.*(?=.{8,})(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=]).*$"
for password in user_input:
    if re.search(pattern, password):

    else:
        pass
```
### Question 14:
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is: 1: Sort based on name; 2: Then sort based on age; 3: Then sort by score. The priority is that name > age > score. If the following tuples are given as input to the program: Tom,19,80 John,20,90 Jony,17,91 Jony,17,93 Json,21,85 Then, the output of the program should be: [('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
#### Solution
```python
result = list()
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter the (name, age, height) : ")
    if user_input:
        result.append(tuple(user_input.split(",")))
    else:
        break
print(sorted(result))
```
